# Intermittent Counter Issues in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application involving an incrementing counter.  The counter, located on the '/about' page, intermittently exhibits erratic behavior such as getting stuck or unexpectedly jumping in value. This issue seems to be related to the useEffect hook and the setInterval function, possibly due to asynchronous nature of these functionalities and how they interact within Next.js's rendering cycle.  The solution explores approaches to stabilize the counter update.

## Bug Description:

The counter on the `/about` page does not consistently increment by one every second. Instead, it occasionally pauses, skips numbers, or jumps ahead unexpectedly. This inconsistency makes the counter unreliable and hinders the application's functionality.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.
5. Observe the counter's behavior.  You should see inconsistencies after some time.

## Solution:

The solution involves leveraging the `useRef` hook for tracking the interval ID and ensuring that the `clearInterval` is called appropriately, addressing potential race conditions. The proposed solution is more robust in handling the timing aspect of the counter.
